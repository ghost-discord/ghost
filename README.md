# ghost2 [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ghost2-discord/ghost2.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ghost2-discord/ghost2) [![Maintainability](https://api.codeclimate.com/v1/badges/4fc3a95b114638f25db6/maintainability)](https://codeclimate.com/github/ghost2-discord/ghost2/maintainability) [![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/ghost2-dev/community.svg)](https://gitter.im/ghost2-dev/community?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge)

ghost2 is a modular, multi-feature Discord bot, and the spiritual successor to the original [ghost](https://github.com/ghost2-discord/ghost).
Among its features are a Spring-powered persistence layer, an embedded H2 database, simpler command modules,
Discord4J 3, and approximately 99.8% less spaghetti.
